# Movie Booking System Database

## Overview
This project entails the design and implementation of a relational database in PostgreSQL for managing a movie booking system. This was a group project completed under the course IT214, and all results gained are presented in a PowerPoint presentation along with the theory behind it.

## Objectives
- Design a user-friendly database for movie ticket booking.
- Normalize relations in the database to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to eliminate redundancy.
- Optimize SQL queries for efficient data retrieval.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Management**: A structured approach to manage movie bookings, ensuring data integrity.
- **Normalization**: Achieved BCNF to minimize redundancy and enhance data consistency.
- **Query Optimization**: Enhanced SQL queries for faster and more efficient data retrieval.

## Technologies Used
- **PostgreSQL**: The primary database management system used for the implementation.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Manthan-D-Parmar/Movie-Booking-System-Database.git
```
Open the project in PostgreSQL. Execute the provided DDL script to create the database structure.

## Usage
To use the Movie Booking System Database:

- Execute the provided DDL script to create the database structure.
- Use the provided insert queries to populate the database with sample data.
- Optimize and run SQL queries for data retrieval based on your needs.
